This is an attempt at providing flexible and powerful components to build
web-based user interfaces using the [Brr
toolkit](https://erratique.ch/software/brr) and the
[lwd](https://github.com/let-def/lwd) reactive programming library.

We aim at providing:
- Basic and flexible building blocks, for these pervasive things such as checkboxes, buttons, etc.
- Well typed forms with validation
- More complex components based on these blocks like multiple selects, virtual
  lists and grids, date pickers, calendar views etc.

Currently in a very unstable state, the APIs might change completely from one
day to the other until we settle on something we like.

# OCAMIX

OCAMIX is yet another music client for servers like Jellyfin.

Right now this is very much an early experimental work-in-progress.

This experiment is mostly an excuse to play with the somewhat-new [`brr-lwd`
library](https://ocaml.org/p/brr-lwd/latest) which provides reactive web
programming.

This project features bindings to
[IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) that
should be released independently at some point.
